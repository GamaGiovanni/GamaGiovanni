## Academic Projects üéì
* Here are some of the interesting projects I've worked on during my time at UNICAMP:
- **[Crazychef:](https://github.com/F0rJava/MC322-Colab/tree/main/Crazychef)** A collaborative project for the Object-Oriented Programming course, this interactive game was crafted in Java with the LibGDX framework. It delves into intricate concepts of object-oriented programming, offering an enjoyable and immersive experience.
- **[Public Safety Web Application:](https://github.com/MC426-2s2023/MC426)** As a collaborative endeavor for the Software Engineering discipline, we utilized the Django framework to develop a web application. This project embraced various software engineering methodologies, including the agile method. The application features a dynamic heat map, which dynamically adjusts based on user-reported incidents such as thefts and homicides, addressing critical public safety issues. The incorporation of agile practices facilitated iterative development cycles, allowing for quick adaptation to evolving requirements. Additionally, the collaborative nature of the project encouraged diverse inputs and perspectives, enriching both the development process and the final product.
- **Scientific Research in Self Sovereign Identities:** During the period of 2022-2023, I conducted research in the field of information security, specifically in the area of identity management, focusing on studying the cost-benefit relationship of authentication via Self-Sovereign Digital Identities. Through this research, we established contact with the Identity Management Laboratory (GIdLab) at RNP. Additionally, an article was submitted and accepted for presentation at the Brazilian Symposium on Information Security and Computer Systems (SBSeg) 2023, which took place in Juiz de Fora - MG.
